# DataBase-Connection-with-Spring-Boot
Project Title: Employee Data API

Description:

The Employee Data API is a Spring Boot application that connects to a database to retrieve employee information and provides JSON endpoints for viewing the data. This project focuses on exposing the employee data in a machine-readable JSON format, making it easy for other applications or clients to consume the data.

Key Features:

Database Setup: Configure a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2) to store employee data. Define the database connection properties in the Spring Boot application's configuration file (application.properties or application.yml).

Entity Class: Create an entity class (e.g., Employee) and annotate it with @Entity to represent the structure of the employee data table in the database. Define attributes such as employee ID, name, email, department, and any other relevant information.

Spring Data JPA: Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the database. Create a repository interface (e.g., EmployeeRepository) that extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long>. This repository will provide methods for retrieving employee data.

Controller: Develop a controller (e.g., EmployeeController) to handle HTTP requests and map them to appropriate service methods. Implement endpoints for retrieving all employees, viewing individual employee details by ID, and any other desired queries.

JSON Response: Configure the controller to return employee data as JSON responses. You can use the @RestController annotation on the controller class to simplify this.

View All Employees: Implement an endpoint that returns a JSON array containing all employee records.

View Employee Details: Implement an endpoint that retrieves employee details by ID and returns them as JSON.

Search and Filter: Add query parameters to the endpoints to allow users to search for specific employees based on criteria like name, department, or other attributes.

Error Handling: Implement error handling to provide appropriate JSON responses in case of invalid queries or database errors.

Testing: Write unit tests for controllers and services to ensure the application's reliability.

Documentation: Create API documentation that describes the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

Deployment: Deploy the application to a local Tomcat or embedded server. You can use tools like Postman or CURL to test the API endpoints and view employee data in JSON format.

By developing this Employee Data API, you will create a RESTful web service that exposes employee data in JSON format. This project can serve as a basis for building more complex APIs and integrating with other systems that need to consume employee data in a structured format.
